## Overview

Transient is a temporary, unlisted audio sharing service. What does that even mean? The intended use-case looks kind of like this:

> An artist would like to share audio files for collaboration, but does not want to lose file integrity or post the files publicly.

Using Transient, the artist can upload their tracks with a limited number of plays available. After these plays have been exhausted, the track is deleted forever from the server.

This can be useful not only for near-release tracks, but also with stems. Uploading multiple files under a single link is a WIP, but you can do so by uploading stems separately.

## Live Deployment

Transient is not yet ready for deployment, though a link to the production site will be supplied when it is ready.
